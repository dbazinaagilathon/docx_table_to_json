      "messages": "The MAS-B will be used to evaluate spasticity based on grading the resistance encountered in a specific muscle group by means of passively moving a limb through its range of motion at a study-specified velocity. The resistance encountered to passive stretch is graded from 0 = no increase in muscle tone to 4 = affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension. The same investigator should perform this measure at each visit, if possible."
